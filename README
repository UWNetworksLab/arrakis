Barrelfish Overview
--------------------------------

Barrelfish currently runs on:

 * x86 CPUs in either IA-32 or AMD64 mode. The following are known to work:

   - Intel Xeon Clovertown, Gainestown, Beckton (X5355, E5520, X7560, L5520,
     L7555)
   - AMD Opteron Santa Rosa, Barcelona, Shanghai, Istanbul, Magny Cours
     (2220, 8350, 8374, 8380, 8431, 6174)
   - QEMU simulator

 * Intel Single-Chip Cloud Computer (SCC), both Copper Ridge and Rocky Lake
   are known to work.

 * ARM CPUs, specifically ARMv7 and ARMv5. The following platforms are known to work:

   - The Texas Instruments OMAP4460 Pandaboard ES SoC
     (Barrelfish runs on both the A9 and the M3 cores)
   - The ARM VExpress EMM board as simulated by GEM5
   - There is also limited support for the Netronome i8000 card, incorporating
     a single Intel iXP2800 processor

This README file provides instructions for the x86 architecture. For other
architectures, please refer to the architecture-specific technical notes (e.g.,
see TN 06 for the SCC, and TN 17 for ARM).

You can either generate the latest documentation from this source-code
(instructions at end of this file), or visit the Barrelfish_ website
to download them.

Supported PC hardware
--------------------------------

Barrelfish supports following PC hardware :

 * x86 CPUs in either IA-32 or AMD64 mode. The following are known to work:

   - Intel Xeon Clovertown, Gainestown, Beckton (X5355, E5520, X7560, L5520,
     L7555)
   - AMD Opteron Santa Rosa, Barcelona, Shanghai, Istanbul, Magny Cours
     (2220, 8350, 8374, 8380, 8431, 6174)

The biggest compatibility problems are likely to be in the PCI/ACPI code. We
usually discover new quirks (or missing functionality in the ACPI glue code)
on each new machine we test. The following systems are known to work:

 * Intel x5000XVN
 * Tyan n6650W and S4985
 * Supermicro H8QM3-2
 * Dell PowerEdge R610 and R905
 * Sun Fire X2270 and X4440
 * Intel/Quanta QSSC-S4R
 * Lenovo X200 and X301 laptops
 * ASUS Eee PC 1015PEM netbooks

The e1000n driver should work with most recent Intel gigabit ethernet
controllers (see the list in devices/e1000.dev). We've mostly used the
82572EI (PCI device ID 0x1082).

You should also be able to boot Barrelfish on a recent version of QEMU (0.14);
note that the e1000 device emulated by QEMU is not supported by our driver.

Required Tools
--------------------------------

The following are required to build Barrelfish and its tools:

 * GCC 4.x

   - 4.4.5, and 4.5.2 are known to work
   - cross-compiling between i386 and x86_64 works (requires libc6-dev-i386
     to build 32 bit on 64 bit machine)
   - for the ARM port, we recommend the EABI tools available from CodeSourcery_.
 * GNU binutils (2.19 is known to work)
 * GNU make
 * GHC v7.4 and Parsec 3.1
   - older versions of the tree supported v6.10 or v6.12.2 with Parsec 2.1
   - GHC v6.12.1 has a known bug and is unable to build our tools
   - earlier versions of GHC are unsupported

Our build system may not be very portable; if in doubt, try building on a
recent Debian or Ubuntu system, as these are what we use.

Building
--------------------------------

1. Assuming you have already unpacked the sources, create a build directory ::

    $ mkdir build && cd build

1. Run ``hake.sh``, giving it the path to the source directory and target
architecture(s) ::

    $ ../hake/hake.sh -s ../ -a x86_64

This will configure the build directory and use GHC to compile and then run
hake, a tool used to generate the ``Makefile``.

3. Optionally, edit the configuration parameters in ``hake/Config.hs`` and
run ``make rehake`` to apply them.

4. Run make, and wait ::

    $ make

5. If everything worked, you should now be able to run Barrelfish inside QEMU ::

    $ make sim


Installing and Booting
--------------------------------

Barrelfish requires a Multiboot-compliant bootloader that is capable of loading
an ELF64 image. At the time of writing, this doesn't include the default GRUB.
Your options are either:

 * use the pre-loader "elver" that can be found in the tools directory
 * patch GRUB to support a 64-bit kernel image, using this patch_.

.. _patch: http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?17963

"Installing" Barrelfish currently consists of copying the ELF files for the CPU
driver and user programs to a location that the target machine can boot from,
and writing a suitable menu.lst file that instructs the bootloader (GRUB) which
programs to load and the arguments to pass them.

If you specify an appropriate INSTALL_PREFIX, ``make install`` will copy the
binaries to the right place for you, eg ::

    $ make install INSTALL_PREFIX=/tftpboot/barrelfish

We usually boot Barrelfish via PXE/TFTP, although loading from a local disk
also works. Instructions for setting up GRUB to do this are beyond the scope of
this document. Assuming you have such a setup, here is a sample menu.lst file
for a basic diskless boot that doesn't do anything useful beyond probing the
PCI buses and starting a basic shell ::

    title   Barrelfish
    root    (nd)
    kernel /barrelfish/x86_64/sbin/elver
    module /barrelfish/x86_64/sbin/cpu
    module /barrelfish/x86_64/sbin/init
    module /barrelfish/x86_64/sbin/mem_serv
    module /barrelfish/x86_64/sbin/monitor
    module /barrelfish/x86_64/sbin/ramfsd boot
    module /barrelfish/x86_64/sbin/skb boot
    modulenounzip /barrelfish/skb_ramfs.cpio.gz nospawn
    module /barrelfish/x86_64/sbin/acpi boot
    module /barrelfish/x86_64/sbin/pci boot
    module /barrelfish/x86_64/sbin/spawnd boot
    module /barrelfish/x86_64/sbin/serial
    module /barrelfish/x86_64/sbin/fish

There are many other programs you can load (take a look around the usr tree for
examples). To start a program on a core other than the BSP core, pass
``core=N`` as its first argument.

If things work, you should see output on both the VGA console and COM1.

Generating Documentation
--------------------------------

Barrelfish documentation can be found on Barrelfish website
(http://www.barrelfish.org/). And it can be also generated from the code tree.
For documentation generation, you will need ``latex`` packages installed,
including support for ``pdflatex``.  Following are the instructions for
generating the documentation assuming you have already unpacked the sources ::

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ ../hake/hake.sh -s ../
    $ make docs

You will find all the technotes in ``docs/`` directory.

Known Issues
--------------------------------

There are many. Those you're likely to encounter include:

 * The documentation is incomplete and out of date.
 * Some drivers and user programs are known not to build, and are
   not included in the default set of targets (MODULES) in the Makefile.

Likely FAQs
--------------------------------

Q: How do I run a program?
A: Add it to the boot sequence by specifying the module in your menu.lst file.
   For example, to run the memtest program, add the line:
       module /PATH/x86_64/sbin/memtest
   to the end of menu.lst, where PATH is relative either to your TFTP
   server's root directory (when booting on hardware) or to your build
   directory (when using a simulator such as QEMU).
   If memtest runs, you should see it output "memtest passed successfully!".

Q: Where's the CPU driver?
A: It's in the directory named kernel :) But don't worry, it really does run
   independently on each core.

Q: Where is the source for the SPLASH2 benchmarks? It seems to be missing.
A: The license for these prevents redistribution, so we were forced to ship our
   changes as a patch. See usr/splash2/README for further instructions.

Q: Can I use a debugger?
A: Maybe. There are two options at the moment:
    * On a simulator, using whatever debug interfaces it supports.
      For QEMU, you could try the "debugsim" target.
    * On hardware, using the kernel-mode remote GDB stubs that operate on the
      primary serial port and are entered in response to a kernel trap or
      exception. However, these are not well maintained, and may not be usable
      beyond reading/writing memory locations and inspecting the stack.
   When debugging the kernel, beware that it is relocated to an address
   determined at core boot time. Look for output such as:
   "Kernel starting at address 0xffffffffc072b000".

Q: Where can I find more information, including papers and new releases?
A: http://www.barrelfish.org/

Q: Can I contribute?
A: We'd certainly like to hear from you. Please send us mail.
