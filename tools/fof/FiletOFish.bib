	abstract = {This paper presents the formal verification of a compiler front-end that translates a subset of the C language into the Cminor intermediate language. The semantics of the source and target languages as well as the translation between them have been written in the specification language of the Coq proof assistant. The proof of observational semantic equivalence between the source and generated code has been machine-checked using Coq. An executable compiler was obtained by automatic extraction of executable Caml code from the Coq specification of the translator, combined with a certified compiler back-end generating PowerPC assembly code from Cminor, described in previous work.},

@inproceedings{swierstra-beast,
	abstract = {It can be very difficult to debug impure code, let alone prove its correctness. To address these problems, we provide a functional specification of three central components of Peyton Jones's awkward squad: teletype IO, mutable state, and concurrency. By constructing an internal model of such concepts within our programming language, we can test, debug, and reason about programs that perform IO as if they were pure. In particular, we demonstrate how our specifications may be used in tandem with QuickCheck to automatically test complex pointer algorithms and concurrent programs.},

This note presents a new design for pretty printers which improves on Hughes's classic design. The new design is based on a single concatenation operator which is associative and has a left and right unit. Hughes's design requires two separate operators for concatenation, where horizontal concatenation has a right unit but no left unit, and vertical...},
