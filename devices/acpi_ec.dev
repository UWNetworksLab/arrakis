 * DESCRIPTION: ACPI Embedded Controller (EC)
 *
 * This file describes the interface to the ACPI standard embedded controller.
 * See ACPI specification v4.0 section 12.2 (p445).
 *
 * The EC device consists of two 8-bit registers: status/command and data.
 *
 * FIXME: according to the ACPI spec (12.11) the controller may reside in
 *   either IO or memory space. This driver assumes IO (because supporting
 *   both in Mackerel would be quite clunky).
