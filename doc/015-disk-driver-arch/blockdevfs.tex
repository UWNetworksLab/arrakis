Barrelfish offers a simple \acs{vfs} layer for accessing different filesystems.
blockdevfs adds a further layer to facilitate exporting of file-like objects to
the filesystem layer.  There is no restriction on the nature of these files,
apart from having to be of a fixed size.

The backends of blockdevfs can expose an arbitrary number of filenames. The
filenames from different backends are combined to form the root directory of
the blockdevfs filesystem. \acs{vfs} calls are mapped to the corresponding backend.
The filesystem only consists of a single directory with no nested directories.
Files cannot be created nor deleted or truncated.

\section{Datastructures}

blockdevfs keeps a very simple doubly-linked list of directory entries.  These
entries contain a file name, file position, file size, backend type and backend
handle. blockdevfs does not enforce any kind of order in this list. Therefore,
enumerating the contents of the blockdevfs root directory will yield the files
registered by blockdevfs backends in the order they were added to blockdevfs.
When routing \acs{vfs} calls to the right backend, the number stored in backend type
is used as an index into the \lstinline+backends+ array holding function
pointers to the backend's operations.

Figure \ref{fig:blockdevfs_list} shows how the directory structure looks like
with two entries. \lstinline+prev+ and \lstinline+next+ are used to implement
the linked list. \lstinline+path+ holds a pointer to the filename.
\lstinline+size+ contains the size of the file in bytes. \lstinline+type+ is
either $0$ for the \emph{libahci} backend or $1$ for the Flounder-based
backend. \lstinline+backend_handle+ points to an internal handle private to the
backend. \lstinline+open+ is a boolean value indicating if the file has been
opened already.

blockdevfs backends must use the \lstinline+blockdev_append_entry+ function to
register files they export.

\section{Backend API}

blockdevfs only exports \lstinline+blockdev_append_entry+ which can be used by
backends to register their exported files. A backend can choose the
\lstinline+backend_handle+ freely. This handle will be passed as an argument to
all \acs{vfs} related functions.

For standard \acs{vfs} operations, backends need to provide these four functions:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \lstinline+open(void *handle)+ to open an exported file. The backend does not have to check or manipulate any blockdevfs-specific structures. blockdevfs ensures that only one client has a file open concurrently.
 \item \lstinline+close(void *handle)+ to close a previously opened file. As with open, blockdevfs takes care of manipulating its structures.
 \item \lstinline+read(void *handle, size_t pos, void *buffer, size_t bytes,+\\
       \lstinline+	size_t *bytes_read)+ to read from the file corresponding to the handle.
 \item \lstinline+write(void *handle, size_t pos, void *buffer, size_t bytes,+\\
       \lstinline+	size_t *bytes_written)+ to write to the file corresponding to the handle.
 \item \lstinline+flush(void *handle)+ to flush all data of the file
 		correpsonding to the handle to persistent storage.
\end{itemize}

All functions are supplied with the backend-handle associated with the
corresponding file.

\section{Usage}

blockdevfs can by mounted by issuing \verb+mount mountpoint blockdevfs://+ and
does not accept any further parameters.

Upon mounting, blockdevfs initializes its backends which in turn populate the
list of directory entries. Listing the directory contents will yield any
attached disk drives and report their sizes.

\section{Backends}

Currently the block device file system has two backends. One backend uses
libahci stand-alone and the other backend uses the Flounder-generated \ac{ata}
interface. The backends are named the \emph{ahci} and \emph{ata} backend
respectively.

As both these backends expose the same devices (namely any \ac{sata} disks
attached to the \ac{ahci} controller), the file names for the devices are
composed of the backend name and the device's unique id, e.g. \emph{ahci0} and
\emph{ata0} for the device with unique id $0$. Keep in mind that \emph{ahcid}
prevents concurrent access, therefore you can't open the respective \emph{ata}
and \emph{ahci} devices at the same time.

\subsection{AHCI Backend}

The \ac{ahci} blockdevfs backend implements the open and close commands by
calling the corresponding functions in libahci (\ahciinit and
\lstinline+ahci_close+) and implements read and write by allocating a \acs{dma}
buffer using \lstinline+ahci_dma_region_alloc+, constructing an appropriate
\ac{fis} and calling \issuecmd. The read implementation updates the
\lstinline+rx_vtbl.command_completed+ pointer to point to
\lstinline+rx_read_command_completed_cb+. That function then uses
\lstinline+ahci_dma_region_copy_out+ to copy the read bytes from the \acs{dma}
buffer to the user buffer, frees the \acs{dma} buffer, and calls the user
continuation. The write implementation copies the bytes that need to be written
to the \acs{dma} buffer (using \lstinline+ahci_dma_region_copy_in+) and updates
the \lstinline+rx_vtbl.command_completed+ pointer to point to
\lstinline+rx_write_command_completed_cb+ which frees the \acs{dma} buffer and
calls the user continuation.  Flush is implemented by issuing the {\tt FLUSH
CACHE} \ac{ata} command which flushes the on-disk cache to the harddisk proper.

\subsection{ATA Backend}

The \ac{ata} blockdevfs backend implements the open command by initializing an
\acs{rpc} client to the \lstinline+ata_rw28+ Flounder \acs{ahci} interface. The
close command just calls \verb+ahci_+ \verb+close+ so that a subsequent open-call
on the same blockdevfs file is successful.  The read, write and flush commands
are easy to implement using the \acs{rpc} client to the Flounder \acs{ahci}
interface by just calling the \lstinline+read_dma+, \lstinline+write_dma+ and
\lstinline+flush_cache+ functions in the \acs{rpc} function table.

\section{Restrictions}

As blockdevfs is only intended to provide a simple way for \acs{vfs} aware
applications (e.g. fish) it has several restrictions:

\begin{itemize}
 \item The size of the files should not change. Although a backend might change
	 the size stored in the handle dynamically, blockdevfs is not geared
	 towards this.
 \item Subdirectories are not supported.
 \item Only one client can have a file open.
 \item Files cannot be removed, neither by the user nor by the backend.
\end{itemize}

\section{VFS adaptation}

In order to ensure that data written to a block device really gets written to
the hard disk, we added a new \acs{vfs} call, namely \lstinline+vfs_flush+,
which is used to flush the hard disk's volatile cache. \lstinline+vfs_flush+
returns \lstinline+VFS_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED+ for \acs{vfs} backends that have no
handler for flush in their \lstinline+struct vfs_ops+ table.
